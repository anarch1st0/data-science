# Automobile Sales Data Visualization

This project contains comprehensive data visualization and dashboard development for automobile sales analysis using Plotly and Dash.

## Project Overview

This assignment is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Plotly Visualizations
Static visualizations using Plotly library covering:
- **Line Charts:** Sales trends over time
- **Bar Charts:** Sales by category and region
- **Pie Charts:** Market share distributions
- **Scatter Plots:** Correlation analysis between variables
- **Histogram/Distribution plots:** Sales distribution analysis

### Part 2: Interactive Dash Dashboard
Web-based interactive dashboard featuring:
- **Dropdown Menus:** Dynamic data filtering
- **Dynamic Plotting:** Real-time chart updates
- **Year-wise Statistics:** Historical trend analysis
- **Recession Period Analysis:** Economic impact visualization
- **Multi-chart Dashboard:** Comprehensive sales overview

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries Used
```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px
import dash
from dash import dcc, html, Input, Output
import numpy as np
```

### Dashboard Features

#### Interactive Components
1. **Year Selector:** Dropdown menu for year-wise filtering
2. **Report Type:** Toggle between yearly statistics and recession analysis
3. **Vehicle Type Filter:** Filter by automobile categories
4. **Real-time Updates:** Charts update based on user selections

#### Visualization Types
1. **Yearly Automobile Sales:** Line chart showing sales trends
2. **Sales by Vehicle Type:** Bar chart comparisons
3. **Market Share Analysis:** Pie chart distributions
4. **Regional Sales Performance:** Geographic analysis
5. **Recession Impact Analysis:** Economic downturn effects

### Key Insights

#### Sales Trends
- Peak sales periods identification
- Seasonal patterns and cyclical trends
- Growth and decline periods analysis

#### Market Analysis
- Best-performing vehicle categories
- Regional sales variations
- Customer preference patterns

#### Economic Impact
- Recession period sales drops
- Recovery patterns post-recession
- Economic indicator correlations

## How to Run

### Part 1: Static Visualizations
```bash
jupyter notebook Automobile_Sales_Data_Visualization.ipynb
```
Run cells sequentially to generate static Plotly charts.

### Part 2: Interactive Dashboard
```bash
# From the notebook, run the dashboard cells
# Dashboard will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8050/
```

The dashboard launches a local web server accessible in your browser.
